Introduction to component- 
->a component represent the part of user interface
->component are reusable and can be use in anywhere in user interface
There are mainly two components in React:
Functional Components also known as Stateless component
Class Component also known as Stateful component
Functional Component or Stateless Component:
It is simple javascript functions that simply returns html UI
It is also called “stateless” components because they simply accept data and display them in some form that is they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
It accept properties(props) in function and return html(JSX)
It gives solution without using state
There is no render method used in functional components.
These can be typically defined using arrow functions but can also be created with the regular function keyword.
example:
//with arrow function
import React from “react”;
const Person = (props) => (
 <div>
 <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
 </div>
);
export default Person;
//without arrow function
import React from “react”;
function Person(props){
return (
 <div>
 <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
 </div>
)
};
 
export default Person;
